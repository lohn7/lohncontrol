bursadelohn.ro is a B2B platform dedicated to the lohn textile industry in Romania. 

The idea has been developed from concept to reality in 2016 and has
become fully operational in 2017. It is the only platform of its kind in the world and has been developed by a in-house manufacturer, so the project is based on
concrete entrepreneurial experience. It operates in a market that topped about 6 billion euros in exports and attracted organically about 10% of Romanian
lohn-textile companies.
