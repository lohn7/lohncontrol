How does a lohn contract work in blockchain ?

The contract between the buyer and the producer also involves third entities that lead to the completion in good conditions thereof. These are the carriers who deliver the raw materials and other goods required to achieve the production in the first phase, and then they pick up the finished products to deliver  them  to  the  buyer.  Domestic  suppliers  of  raw  materials,  related services and utilities represent another important category for the success of the production. 
Above all there are the quality control experts natural or legal persons, who follow on behalf of the buyer the entire production process, from the delivery of the raw materials, the quality thereof, supply or delivery times, the quality of the goods or services provided by the domestic supplier, the timeliness of the deliveries or of the transportation of the goods and, in particular, the proper execution of the production by observing the buyer's technological indications.
The contribution of each of the involved parties is governed by IF/THEN-type smart contracts subordinated to the main contract between the buyer and the producer. 
Chaining and the proper execution of these complementary smart contracts lead in the end to a rigorous achievement of the main contract between the parties.

1.  Until  choosing  a  winning  bid  of  a  producer,  the  buyer  must  acquire  a number of LOHN tokens equal to the total bid amount + the 3% commission due to the lohncontract.com platform. 
2.The purchased tokens will be immobilized in the lohncontrol smart contract until the contract is concluded and then transferred to the manufacturer who will sell the tokens on the free market or to the lohncontract.com platform. 3.Token acquisition is primarily from the free market and if there are not enough tokens available for sale, they can be purchased in addition to the platform's stock at market price.
4. The tokens can be transferred to the manufacturers as a payment and they can keep or sell them either on the free market of lohncontract.com at the market price.
5.   The   Market LOHN Value(MkLV) will  be  calculated  in  real-time  and will be displayed continuously on the platform's front page. 
The use of the platform by buyers, as manufacturing order makers is conditional upon the immobilisation in a lohncontrol smart contract of a number of LOHN tokens equal to the amount that it has to pay for the placed order. This means that all the time active request value (AVR) must be covered by LOHN token. If the active requests amount increases, the LOHN tokens that are in a predetermined number will have to cover this value and automatically will increase too. Because the 1B LOHN token to the $ 0.06 ITO value can only cover a $ 60M active request, any $ 60M increase in the value of active requests placed on the platform will cause a proportional increase in the token value LOHN that has to support the platform as a kind of escrow agent. This increase, proportional to the platform's use, was determined by a mathematical calculation materialized in a growth algorithm that includes multiple variables such as the availability of LOHN tokens on the free market or 

----------------------------------------------------
MkLV = ARV/ATxATL 
----------------------------------------------------

where
MkLV - Market LOHN Value
ARV   - Active Requests Value 
AT      - Available Tokens and its represent  the difference between CT (circulating tokens) and TUC(tokens used in contracts)
AT=CT â€“ TUC
CT       - Circulating Tokens
TUC    - Tokens Used in Contracts
ATL    - Available Tokens Liquidity (%)

For example if:
ARV=100Millions USD
AT=1Bilion LOHN tokens
ATL=100%
then
MkLV = ARV/ATxATL=100M/1Bx100%liquidity
MkLV=0,10USD
